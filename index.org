#+begin_quote
Everybody seems to understand that astronomers do astronomy because
astronomy is interesting. Why don't they understand that I do computer
science because computer science is interesting? And that I'd do it
regardless of whether or not it made money for anybody?

* /This website has a seriously drab look, that was outdated already back in the 1990's...!/

- While the look /is/ drab, mainly because I know very little about graphical design
- The website is generated from org-mode in GNU Emacs
- Org-mode is powerful, and I've added support in GNU Emacs for typing in languages, so the combination of left-to-right language and {{{rtl(שָׂפוֹת שֶׁנִּכְתָּבוֹת מִיָּמִין לִשְׂמֹאל\, או كِتَابَتْهَا مِن ٱلْيَمِين إلَى ٱلْيَسَار)}}} is accomplished simply and accurately
- The website is currently (as of 2021) being updated rapidly, and more material is added weekly

So please give the website a second look... \smiley

* /This website is seriously out-of-date...!/

My apologies!

As of around 2014 and until very recently, I was having difficulties updating and managing the website. A combination of technical difficulties, changing platforms, and lack of time to deal with these problems, all prevented me from keeping my website up-to-date. Anyway, I think I managed to solve many of the old problems, and get my website up and running again. I'm updating it continuously. So please stay tuned! \smiley
