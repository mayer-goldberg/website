#+begin_quote
Everybody seems to understand that astronomers do astronomy because
astronomy is interesting. Why don't they understand that I do computer
science because computer science is interesting? And that I'd do it
regardless of whether or not it made money for anybody?

* /This website has a seriously drab look, that was outdated already back in the 1990's...!/

- While the look /is/ drab, mainly because I know very little about graphical design
- The website is generated from org-mode in GNU Emacs
- Org-mode is powerful, and I've added support in GNU Emacs for typing in languages, so the combination of left-to-right language and {{{rtl(שָׂפוֹת שֶׁנִּכְתָּבוֹת מִיָּמִין לִשְׂמֹאל\, או كِتَابَتْهَا مِن ٱلْيَمِين إلَى ٱلْيَسَار)}}} is accomplished simply and accurately
- The website is currently (as of 2021) being updated rapidly, and more material is added weekly

So please give the website a second look... \smiley
