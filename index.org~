#+begin_quote
Everybody seems to understand that astronomers do astronomy because
astronomy is interesting. Why don't they understand that I do computer
science because computer science is interesting? And that I'd do it
regardless of whether or not it made money for anybody?

* /A website that is seriously out-of-date.../

My apologies!

Since around 2014, I was having difficulties updating and managing my website. A combination of technical difficulties, changing platforms, and lack of time, all prevented me from keeping my website up-to-date. Anyway, I think I managed to solve many of the old problems, and get my website up and running again. I'm updating it continuously. So please stay turned! \smiley
