* Introduction

On this page I would like to share some of the instructional material we prepared for homeschooling our son. You are welcome to copy what you like, and we hope you will find it useful. This page is work-in-progress, and I am going to post various worksheets long before I will have time to add explanations as to how to use them. Eventually, each worksheet should have some explanation that goes along with it. Feel free [[mailme][to email me]] if you need instructions for a specific worksheet, and I shall make an effort to add it first.

* Material we prepared

** Mathematics

*** Multiplication worksheets

*** Division worksheets

*** Square root worksheets (by digit-extraction)

*** Square root worksheets (using the /Newton-Raphson/ method)

** Chemistry

*** Chemical equations
